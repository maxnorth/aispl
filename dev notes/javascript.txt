i'm thinking a js file can be provided for jquery style pattern manipulation. $ can be ovverridden with $(elementRef). or maybe 'this' can
be the root.

a ts file can be a full anguglar 2 component. the metadata object will just use the path and generate another file with
imports for each component.

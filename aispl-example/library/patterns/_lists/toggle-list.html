        <p>A smart meter is a digital meter that allows two-way communication between your home and BGE via a wireless network. Customers iwht smart meters have access to information and tools to help manage energy use, leading to lower bills.</p>

    <dt class="exc-toggle-title">Can I optout, or choose not to have a meter installed? <i class="exc-icon-toggle"></i></dt>
    <dd class="exc-toggle-item">
        <p>On February 26, 2014, the Maryland Public Service Commission (PSC) made a decision on smart meter opt out and related costs for customers who do not want a smart meter. If you choose to have a smart meter installed, or keep the smart meter that is already installed, these fees will not apply to you.</p>
        <p>Customers who opt out of having a smart meter installed will be charged a one-time fee of $75, which will be billed in three equal monthly installments, and an additional monthly fee of $11. Customers may <a href="#">opt out online</a>.</p>
        <p>Customers can also call BGE at 800.685.0123, or send a letter to: Smart Meter Opt Out BGE, P.O. Box 1475, Baltimore, MD 21203 and include the following information:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Name(s)</li>
            <li>Address</li>
            <li>Account Number</li>
            <li>Phone Number</li>
            <li>Email Address</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Customers who contacted BGE before the February 26, 2014 PSC order asking to defer their smart meter installation must let us know if they have reconsidered. If we do not hear from these customers, the PSC order provides that we assume these customers will continue as opt-outs and incur the related costs.</p>
        <p>BGE will notify in writing those customers who had previously deferred a smart meter installation. That communication will specifically reference the customer’s right to retain their legacy meter, the fee structure that will apply should they continue to exercise their choice to opt out, and when they can expect to see such one-time and monthly fees applied to their bills.</p>
        <p>BGE will begin billing customers who opted out starting their first full billing cycle after July 1, 2014.</p>
        <p>If you previously opted out but would now like a smart meter, you may <a href="#">opt back in</a>.</p>

    <dd class="exc-toggle-item">
        <p>​While very similar to the existing electric meters, there is one big difference in the appearance of the new smart electric meter: an easy-to-read digital display instead of the spinning wheel or dial that many customers have today.  For most customers, this will be the only obvious difference between the appearance of the old and the new meter. In most cases, we are not replacing your entire gas meter.  We are replacing, or upgrading, one component of the gas meter that will allow two-way communication with BGE. For all BGE customers, the features and benefits that the new meter will bring are far more advanced.</p>

    <dt class="exc-toggle-title">Who manufactures smart meters? <i class="exc-icon-toggle"></i></dt>
    <dd class="exc-toggle-item">
        <p>The smart meters BGE will installed are made by two companies, GE (General Electric) and Landis and Gyr. BGE is also working with a company called Silver Spring Networks that provides the smart grid platform and related software and services.</p>

    <dt class="exc-toggle-title">I rent my home, should I contact my landlord about installing a smart meter? <i class="exc-icon-toggle"></i></dt>
    <dd class="exc-toggle-item">
        <p>It is BGE policy that the account holder (the person who receives the BGE bill) is the person who can make changes or requests regarding an electric or gas account. In the case of smart meters, the account holder or an authorized person can make an appointment to have a smart meter installed --- appointments are needed if at least one meter is located indoors.  If your landlord is the BGE account holder, the landlord should schedule the appointment.  If both the electric and gas meters at the property are located outdoors, no appointment is necessary and BGE will upgrade the meters when next in your neighborhood.</p>

    <dt class="exc-toggle-title">Then what is the difference between my old meter and the smart meter? <i class="exc-icon-toggle"></i></dt>
    <dd class="exc-toggle-item">
        <p>Initially, your new smart meter will perform exactly the way your old meter did. BGE will use it to determine how much energy you have used at the end of each billing period. As more smart meters are installed and enhanced technologies are put into place, many new features will be available to you for use with BGE energy management tools, such as ongoing usage tracking and bill forecasting. These new features will be phased in gradually through 2014; many will be available beginning in late 2012.  BGE will let you know when you can start accessing these features and how to use them.</p>

    <dt class="exc-toggle-title">Do both electric and gas meters have two way capability? <i class="exc-icon-toggle"></i></dt>
    <dd class="exc-toggle-item">
        <p>Yes, but the gas and electric meters do not function in exactly the same way. Electric meters will receive a signal every four hours that prompt the meters to provide usage data.  Gas meters send usage updates to BGE once every 24 hours. Both types of meters can receive programming updates from BGE.</p>

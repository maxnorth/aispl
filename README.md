# liberry - The everyone-friendly pattern library

liberry is a command utility to help you easily set up, develop, and host your own project pattern library.

It's currently still in heavy development, so don't expect anything you set up to keep working between updates.
Semantic versioning was a new concept to us at the outset, so don't expect the versions to mean much of anything.
Until this page says otherwise, expect anything you download to be version 0.

Look forward to updates soon-ish. Thanks!

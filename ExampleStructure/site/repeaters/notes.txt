i'm thinking that the repeaters templates will each get built into a component, and then there will be either
one master 'repeater' component or a repeater manager component per repeater component

pro/contra repeater manager per repeater
priority: functionality. is anything lost by going the single dynamic repeater manager path?
there may be some efficiency concern? every repeater gets repeated - every repetition containing another repeater means the repeatermanager
dynamically bootstrapping so many components on the fly. worth trying out and seeing what happens.
other potential loss - custom selectors? 

should the sort be associated with the repeater or the thing being repeated?
